All the things that I'm learning about games using Java

In this repository I'll put everything that I know and everything that I will learn about games with Java, such as sprite Animation, hitbox sistems, etc.

I'm still learning how to use Github so if you have some hints, talk to me on my e-mail: pedroaugustoa47@gmail.com
